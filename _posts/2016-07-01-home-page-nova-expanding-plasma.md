  Implants are used in a variety of medical applications, such as Orthopedics,
  Spine surgery, Cardio vascular, Dental, and others. Wettability/hydrophilicity
  is a key feature of metal implants, improving implant osseointegration and
  long-term stability. Plasma is well known for its surface activation
  properties, but the hydrophilic properties of implants tend to deteriorate
  between manufacturing date and the actual time of implantation.
